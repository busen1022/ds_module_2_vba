Homework for Module 2 - VBA

In this assignment, we were given raw data files for alphabetical_testing and Multiple_year_stock_data.

Within alphabetical_testing I created a script, "VBA_script," to create a Leaderboard chart and Biggest Movers chart for every sheet of the given workbook. This was then resaved with applied changes. 

The script, "VBA-script," was then applied to a larger set of data, within Multiple_year_stock_data, creating the same Leaderboard Chart and Biggest Movers Chart for every sheet of this given workbook. It was resaved with applied changes and four screenshots were included in this repository, one for each sheet of the workbook.
